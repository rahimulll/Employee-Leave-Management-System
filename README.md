## Employee Leave Management System 
"Employee Leave management system" is a computer program. The primary
function of the system is to display and facilitate the collection of data about
workers' leave information. Employers could gain insight into their employees via
an employee leave management system, which allows them to better plan and
manage work hours, lowering labor expenses and increasing productivity.
The project Leave Management System includes employee login, admin login.
employee login enables employees to view their attendance details and their
leave status. They can also apply for the leave. admin login enables admin to
confirm the leave applied by the employees of their class. They can either accept
or reject the leave. admin can also generate various reports on the leave details.
Attendance percent of the employee calculated automatically and updated.
employees cannot apply for more leave when their attendance percent is below
minimum.
Users may use the leave management system by entering their user ID and
password. Either an administrator or an employee may access it. They alone are
able to add data to the database. The information is simple to get. The user
experience is excellent. Data processing is quick since the data are adequately
safeguarded for personal use. This project was created using MySQL as the back
end and PHP as the front end.
“Employee Leave Management System” has admin and user areas. “Employee
Leave Management System” admins are crucial. He handles system management.
As an admin, the Employee Leave Management System displays the Dashboard,
Department, Leave Type, Employees, and Leave Management. On the Dashboard,
the admin may see the newest applications and their statuses: accepted, pending
approval, and rejected. Admins may add and manage departments. Admins may
add and manage leave types. Admins may add and manage Employees.
Employees must join up to log in and apply for leave.


# PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
This project is aimed at developing a web-based Leave Management Tool, which
is of importance to either an organization or a college. This is an Intranet based
application that can be accessed throughout the organization or a specified
group/Dept. This system can be used to automate the workflow of leave
applications and their approvals. There are features like cancellation of leave,
approval of leave, report generators etc. in this Tool.


# SYSTEM ANALYSIS
After analyzing the requirements of the task to be performed, the next step is to
analyze the problem and understand its context. The first activity in the phase is
studying the existing system and other is to understand the requirements and
domain of the new system. Both the activities are equally important, but the first
activity serves as a basis of giving the functional specifications and then successful
design of the proposed system. Understanding the properties and requirements
of a new system is more difficult and requires creative thinking and understanding
of existing running system is also difficult, improper understanding of present
system can lead diversion from solution.


# ANALYSIS MODEL
The model that is basically being followed is the WATERFALL MODEL, which states
that the phases are organized in a linear order. First of all, the feasibility study is
done. Once that part is over the requirement analysis and project planning
begins. If system exists one and modification and addition of new module is
needed, analysis of present system can be used as basic model.
The design starts after the requirement analysis is complete and the coding
begins after the design is complete. Once the programming is completed, the
testing is done. In this model the sequence of activities performed in a software
development project are: -
• Requirement Analysis
• Project Planning
• System design
• Detail design
• Coding
• Unit testing
• System integration & testing
